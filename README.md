# Power BI Performance Analyzer Visualiser
By Shahid Thaika (shahidt@gmail.com)

**Power BI Performance Analyzer Visualiser** is a Power BI report that helps analyse the json file exported by Power BI's Performance Analyzer feature. You can easily get an idea of which actions take the most time and the factors behind that time.

## Instructions:
1) Duplicate your Power BI report file, rename it with a '.zip' extension, and extract the contents to a folder.
2) Copy the 'Layout' file, from 'Extracted Folder\Report\Layout', to a separate folder.
3) Open your report, start recording on the Performance Analyzer feature in Power BI Desktop, and capture some actions.
4) Export the recording, retaining the PowerBIPerformanceData.json filename, into the same folder as the Layout file.
5) Edit the Parameters in this report, and set the 'Folder Path', and refresh data.
